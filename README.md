# NumJS without image functions

This is a fork of NumJS without image functions. This version does not include sharp.

This version is mostly for use in my own projects to speed up installation.

## Installation
Installation is as simple as:
`npm install https://github.com/okyanusoz/numjs-noimageÂ # (or yarn add https://github.com/okyanusoz/numjs-noimage with Yarn)`

## Docs
Docs are the same as https://github.com/nicolaspanel/numjs, but without the `nj.images` module.
